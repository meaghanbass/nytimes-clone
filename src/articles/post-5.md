Media personality Geoff Keighley will not produce the E3 Coliseum this year.

The E3 Coliseum is a live stage show that was added onto the event back in 2017. It was part of the show's efforts to boost its consumer credentials after it started selling a limited number of tickets to the general public. The Coliseum has featured major developers from PlayStation, Microsoft, Bethesda, Square Enix, Take-Two, Epic and Ubisoft, alongside celebrities such as Jack Black

Keighley, who is best known for running The Game Awards, has led the first three Coliseums. But he says he has declined to take part this year, and that this will be the first time in 25 years he has not participated in E3.

"Given what has been publicly communicated about plans for E3 2020, I just don't feel comfortable participating in the show at this time," Keighley told GamesIndutry.biz. "I saw the E3 website leak this AM and said, "You know what, I really need to let people know what to expect from me, so no one is disappointed." This certainly wasn't an easy decision to make, but I think it's the right one for me -- and I wanted fans to know before tickets go on sale."

    "I think E3 needs to be more digital, global and inclusive in its approach to connecting gamers and celebrating the industry" 

In terms of the future of the event, Keighley feels that E3 does have a future, despite publishers and developers struggling to agree over what the show should be.
